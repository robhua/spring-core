# Test Case Review Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist helps reviewers evaluate the quality, completeness, consistency, and maintainability of generated or manually authored test cases before finalization.

Use this checklist for both AI-generated and manually written test cases. Apply it with the review report template.

---

# Review Guidelines

During the review, verify that the test cases:

- Accurately reflect the requirements.
- Provide sufficient coverage.
- Follow the Test Case Template.
- Comply with the Testing Standard.
- Are executable and maintainable.
- Do not contain duplicate scenarios.
